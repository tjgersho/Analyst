#Analyst

This repository is here to help bring collaboration and growth into the world of Engineering Analysis Tools, and to make the analysis world a better place to be with easy to use interfaces and use anywhere responsive design. This app uses Angular JS and need modules!
Currently it does one thing okay; it solves the Euler Bernoulli equation for structural beam bending analysis. The goal of Analyst is to become the go to place for all types of engineering tools, financial analysis tools, and any other type of tool that should be a nice JavaScript program.

##beamsolver##
Currently the only tool within Analyst, but it is a good one. This tool is used to solve the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation.
